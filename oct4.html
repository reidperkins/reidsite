    <h2>Getting started with Sentinel-1</h2>
    <p>Hello! This is my first blog post. As you can somewhat tell, this site is extremely under construction. I hope you'll bear with me as I continue to develop my web design skills, hopefully getting to the point where this page doesn't look like a X-Files fan site from 1997. For this point, I want to talk a bit about some of the methods I'll be using for my research at Western.

    <p>To start off, let's go on a tangent and talk about the planet Venus. You know Venus. You love Venus. Venus is great! Very hot, very dense atmosphere. Beneath that dense atmosphere are some rocks. If you're like me, you're very interested in what kind of rocks they are. What composition are they? Are they like granites, slowly crystallizing underneath the Earth's crust, or are they like basalts, becoming (figuratively) flash-frozen in a geological second upon intruding through the Earth's crust via a fissure or some other volcanic source? 
    Well, all that atmosphere creates problems if you're thinking of orbiting a standard visible light camera around Venus, imaging the planet using the same wavelengths that our eyes are used to. How do you get through all that atmosphere? You have to use other wavelengths of light that can penetrate through the cloud cover. That's where radio waves come in, having a longer wavelength that is able to pass through water vapor (or carbon dioxide gas) molecules in a way that visible light cannot. In 1961, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory beamed a radio signal at Venus, detecting the "return echo" of the radio wave within minutes.

    <p>Over the years, the imaging of targets using radio waves (better known as radar) become more and more sophisticated, allowing us to peer through dense cloud cover to obtain higher-resolution data of planetary bodies like Venus and Saturn's moon Titan. In addition to allowing data to be collected from targets opaque to visible light imaging, radar also provides much information on the surface properties of the target. It is this area in which my initial research here at Western is concerned.
