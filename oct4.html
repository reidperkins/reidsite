    <h1>Getting started with Sentinel-1 (October 4th, 2021)</h1>
    <p>Hello! This is my first blog post. As you can somewhat tell, this site is extremely under construction. I hope you'll bear with me as I continue to develop my web design skills, hopefully getting to the point where this page doesn't look like a X-Files fan site from 1997.
    <br>For this point, I want to talk a bit about some of the methods I'll be using for my research at Western.
