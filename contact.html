    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <br>
    <p>I am interested in using remote sensing to explore the evolution of planetary surfaces, using techniques such as radar and visible light imagery. At Western, I am working with Dr. Catherine Neish in the <a href="https://planetneish.ca/research.html">Neish Lab</a>. My past research experience includes studying cratering and resurfacing on Venus using reprocessed Magellan data, as well as projects ranging from Mini-RF observations of lunar polar craters to geologic studies of icy satellites such as Europa and Enceladus. Outside of my day job, I enjoy listening to and playing music, watching Star Trek, and going on long walks.</p>
